#plugins.txt documentation to aid in the creation of plugins for penemo.


      penemo uses .pm file for it's plugins. The files by default are located
   in /usr/local/share/penemo/lib/penemo/agent/  (currently filecheck.pm is
   the only plugin included with penemo, however there are several people
   I know of working on plugins, and they will probably be included in the
   next release, if you have developed a plugin for penemo, email me:
   nick@namodn.com).

      The plugins should follow a standard design. If you know any OO Perl
   or maybe OO theory, things will be esier, but even if you don't you can
   do it. Just study the filecheck.pm and mimick it's methods. They must have 
   the following methods in them: 
   
         new (for creating the object for penemo to use). It will pass the 
	     following values in a hash table: 
	     
	         ip   : (ip address of the agent)
	         mod  : (name of the plugin, just
		        for clarity (and debuging))
	         conf : (an array of key=pair values). Do a 
                         my %conf = split(/=/, $self->{conf}); 
		         to get the values into a local hash.
