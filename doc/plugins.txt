#plugins.txt documentation to aid in the creation of plugins for penemo.


      penemo uses .pm file for it's plugins. The files by default are located
   in /usr/local/share/penemo/lib/penemo/agent/  (currently filecheck.pm is
   the only plugin included with penemo, however there are several people
   I know of working on plugins, and they will probably be included in the
   next release, if you have developed a plugin for penemo, email me:
   nick@namodn.com).

      The plugins should follow a standard design. If you know any OO Perl
   or maybe OO theory, things will be esier, but even if you don't you can
   do it. Just study the filecheck.pm and mimick it's methods. They must have 
   the following methods in them: 
   
         new : (for creating the object for penemo to use). It will pass the 
	       following values in a hash table: 
	     
	         ip   : (ip address of the agent)
	         mod  : (name of the plugin, just
		        for clarity (and debuging))
	         conf : (an array of key=pair values). Do a 
                         my %conf = split(/=/, $self->{conf}); 
		         to get the values into a local hash.
         
	 exec : penemo calls this method when it's ready to actually run
	        the check, the work is done within this function, invisible
		to penemo. the following methods are called after exec is
		run, they should contain result info.

	status : reports the result of the exec. returns a 0 (false) for bad, 
	         and a 1 (true) for good

	message : returns the message relating to the status if it was
		  a bad check, this message will be sent to the pager, and
		  printed in red on the web statistics. 

	html : if message was good, this will be the html that is printed on
	       the webpage, enter full html entry for the check (i.e. color,
	       embeded images if any. 


   It is very important to use the filecheck.pm as an example, mimick it 
   whenever there is question on what to do in a circumstance.

   If you have any question, comments, or suggestions on how to improve
   the plugin design. PLEASE email me: nick@namodn.com, and perhaps join
   the penemo users (users@penemo.org) or devel (devel@penemo.org) lists.
