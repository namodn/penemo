penemo changelog

changes from version 1.0 -> 1.0.1
	* minor corrections to some code
	* minor corrections and additions to documentation

changes from version 1.0 BETA3 -> 1.0 (stable)
	* revamped the plugin architecure, uses .pm files now.
	* you can now pass config options to the plugins through the
	  agent.conf (view the plugins.txt for more details). The plugins
	  that can be developed (and have been) will be able to be
	  improved incredibly. Look for inclusions of some of them in
	  the next release hopefully.
	* fixed notify_exec now, should work. Use it as you would notify_email.
	* added pause functionality configuration, you can now move the pause
	  function to the main page (less clicks).
	* you can now pause as long as you like from the web interface 
	  (a good security tip is to make .htaccess authentication for
	  cgi execution, so anyone who clicks pause will have to have a
	  login).
	* several bugfixes too numerous to list.
	* several additional features, the release of penemo would be
	  delayed even further if I was to sit down and try to list them
	  all. Check out the penemo.conf that comes with the dist and
	  check out all the new options, that should give you an idea,
	  along with the agent.conf
	* agent.conf redesigned a bit. Instead of using IP as unique
	  ID, now uses arbitrary string as UID. IP is set in the
	  id tag. This way servers can logically have multiple IP's and
	  it works out very well in fact. Look at the agent.conf's examples
	  to get a better idea of how it works.
	

changes from version 1.0 BETA2 -> 1.0 BETA3
	* changed the html output a little, changed some font's and cleaned up 
	   some layout.
	* fixed a time problem with the penemo-admin.cgi (problem splitting 
	   date string).
	* modified the notification messages to be less "wordy".
	* made all the little LED's have transparent backgrounds (in case
	   someone wants to go and change the background to blaring white :)


changes from version 1.0 BETA1 -> 1.0 BETA2
	* notify_cap (specifies the cap at which to stop sending notifications).
	* html display for the configuration options set for each agent (link 
	   from detailed agent display).
        * yellow 'warning' light for when an error is detected yet a notification 
	   is not being sent.  
	* notification bugfix

changes from version 0.7 -> 1.0 BETA1
        * complete code re-structuring (using object oriented design
           with perl).
        * tier levels for notification 
        * resolved notification. send page to whatever tier it was on, to let 
           everyone know the problem is resolved.  
        * check funtion for plugins.  
        * extensive pausing features 
	* images instead of colored '*' for warning LED's (thanks to Mike 
	  Tuller)


changes from version 0.6 -> 0.7
        * now use Net::Ping module for initial ping check (instead
           of using the command line ping). Noticed problem with 
           RedHat 5.2 installs: the ping timeout param wasn't actually 
           timing out and therefore hung penemo. 
          

changes from version 0.5 -> 0.6
        * added ability to execute multiple command line arguments. (duh).
        * added two command line options, -rc (Read penemo Config) and 
           -ra (Read Agent config)both take one arg. which is the complete 
           path to the alternate config file to read.
        * small bugfixes here and there.

changes from version 0.4 -> 0.5
        * made http type in agent.conf able to perform several http request
           (unlimited) per agent entry (previously it was just one).

changes from version 0.3 -> 0.4
        * set ping timeout from 1 try, to 2. this makes script run a
           little slower if a machine is unpingable, but helps account
           for a possible slow ping response (resulting in a bogus
           notification).
        * added a ping_wait option in the penemo.conf to make the value
           (referenced above) changeable.
        * changed the command line args a little (run penemo --help to see).
        * added a new command line argument '-pc' (print config). prints
           a rudimentary display of the settings in the penemo.conf.
           (still need to fix it so it prints hashes of hashes instead of
           the memory address).

changes from version 0.2 -> 0.3
        * minor bug fixes
        * added 'community' tag in penemo.conf 
           (forgot to do this in first version).

changes from version 0.1 -> 0.2
        * fixed http://<url>"<search" function (wasnt working properly).
        * small bug fixes to avoid "undefined variable testing".
