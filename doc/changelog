penemo changelog

changes from version 0.7 to 1.0
        * complete code re-structuring (using object oriented design
           with perl).
        * tier levels for notification 
        * resolved notification. send page to whatever tier it was on, to let 
           everyone know the problem is resolved.  
        * check funtion for plugins.  
        * extensive pausing features 
        * yellow light for when an error is detected yet a notification is not 
	   being sent.  
	* lots more. too numerous to list.

changes from version 0.6 to 0.7
        * now use Net::Ping module for initial ping check (instead
           of using the command line ping). Noticed problem with 
           RedHat 5.2 installs: the ping timeout param wasn't actually 
           timing out and therefore hung penemo. 
          

changes from version 0.5 to 0.6
        * added ability to execute multiple command line arguments. (duh).
        * added two command line options, -rc (Read penemo Config) and 
           -ra (Read Agent config)both take one arg. which is the complete 
           path to the alternate config file to read.
        * small bugfixes here and there.

changes from version 0.4 to 0.5
        * made http type in agent.conf able to perform several http request
           (unlimited) per agent entry (previously it was just one).

changes from version 0.3 to 0.4
        * set ping timeout from 1 try, to 2. this makes script run a
           little slower if a machine is unpingable, but helps account
           for a possible slow ping response (resulting in a bogus
           notification).
        * added a ping_wait option in the penemo.conf to make the value
           (referenced above) changeable.
        * changed the command line args a little (run penemo --help to see).
        * added a new command line argument '-pc' (print config). prints
           a rudimentary display of the settings in the penemo.conf.
           (still need to fix it so it prints hashes of hashes instead of
           the memory address).

changes from version 0.2 to 0.3
        * minor bug fixes
        * added 'community' tag in penemo.conf 
           (forgot to do this in first version).

changes from version 0.1 to 0.2
        * fixed http://<url>"<search" function (wasnt working properly).
        * small bug fixes to avoid "undefined variable testing".
