1. http check fails even though URL specified is good.
-
   Q.  In the agent.conf I have the line:

         http	url="http://www.somedomain.com"

       In one of my agents config. I know the URL is good,
      but penemo is failing on it.

   
   A.  Depending on the http fetching program you are using
      (i.e. wget, fetch, or snarf) you may need to specify
      the exact file to grab. If you have problems, try:

         http	url="http://www.somedomain.com/index.html"

       or whichever specific document you are trying to reach.
