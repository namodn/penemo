1. Checks
-----------

   1.1 HTTP check fails even though URL specified is good.
       In the agent.conf I have the line:
         http  url="www.somedomain.com"
       In one of my agents config. I know the URL is good,
       but penemo is failing on it.
  
       a). Depending on the http fetching program you are using
           (i.e. wget, fetch, or snarf) you may need to specify
           the exact file to grab. If you have problems, try:
           http  url="www.somedomain.com/index.html"
           or whichever specific document you are trying to reach.



   1.2 How do I specify which values to report in the penemo SNMP checks?

       a). To control the data recieved from the snmp checks (i.e. monitor
           disk size/load avg and more) you must configure the ucd-snmp
           daemon (man snmpd.conf). If you've compiled ucd-snmp from source,
           the config file should be in /usr/local/share/snmpd.conf. 
           For example:
         
             
             load 10 5 5  
 
             proc init
             proc sshd2
             proc syslogd
             proc cron
             proc httpd
 
             disk    /       15%    # percentage is min. free space before 
	     			    # errflag
             disk    /usr    20%    # is set for the specified partition.
             disk    /var    20%
             disk    /home       15%
             disk    /var/log        15


           That's what I usually use as a generic snmpd config. The way this
           works is penemo sends a request to the agent (machine you wish to
           monitor) to get all of it's snmp data for a specific mib (ucd, mib-2)
           etc. The agents snmpd returns data based on this config file (i.e.
           it returns a list of monitored daemons with an errorflag set on
           any that may not be running. Likewise with disk capacity 
	   specifications.

2. Pausing
-----------
-
   2.1 When I click pause on the web interface, I get an internal server error.

       a). This probably means the webserver does not have permision to
           access the cgi. Make sure it is either owned by the webserver
           or its group, or that o=rx. 



   2.2 After I click pause, and enter the time limit, when I click submit, 
       I get an internal server error.

       a). This usually means the cgi does not have permision to write to
           the penemo data directory (where it keeps persistent agent 
	   information, like error levels, pausing info etc. 
      
           The data directory (by default located in 
	   /usr/local/share/penemo/data)
	   
           must be rwx either with the webservers user or group. 

           It is not reccomended to set o=rwx on the data directory, that would
           allow any user to change internal agent data and pause agents for
           extended amounts of time etc.
