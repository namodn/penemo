penemo version: 1.0.1

Developed and Maintained,

INTRODUCTION

 penemo is a remote monitoring program, written in perl. It is designed to 
 implement a number of check features such as ping, http, and snmp. A plugin
 method has been designed to allow you to add different snmp mibs to check
 as well as a more generic plugin method so that you can write your own
 script to check whatever you want and return certain values to let penemo
 know if the check was succesfull or not.
 
 penemo requires UCD-SNMP to be installed on systems that you wish to be snmp 
 polled, as well as the machine this program will run on (it needs access 
 to the snmpwalk command). However, None of the UCD-SNMP stuff is required 
 if all you wish to do is ping hosts, perform http requests, and use plugins.



SUPPORTED ARCHITECHURES

 penemo was developed on a Debian GNU/Linux system. And has only been tested
 with Linux and FreeBSD. However, it should theoretically run fine on any UNIX
 system that Perl and UCD-SNMP can compile on.



INSTALLATION

 for installation instructions please read the install.txt



CONFIGURATION

 there are two configuration files for penemo (in /usr/local/etc/penemo/).

        penemo.conf - this file covers all of the configuration options
                      that specify how penemo is to run. here is where
		      you also specify the default values for agents,
		      (these values are set if you havent specified
		       otherwise in the agents.conf).

        agent.conf - this file covers the configuration for the agents
                     that penemo is to monitor. here you specify what
                     to monitor for each agent, etc.

 both of these files have fairly detailed comments for each option, in an
 attempt to be self documenting. edit both of these files and set any values
 that may need to be set accordingly to the way your system is configured.

 sometimes the default options in the penemo.conf work fine for what you 
 are doing.

 penemo's html output is (by default) in /usr/local/share/penemo/html you
 can symlink this directory to the directory apache has its htdocs to make
 the html viewable from the web (remote).

 I recommend the following:

        # ln -s /usr/local/share/penemo/html <apache_html_dir>/penemo

 or you can set the html output (dir_html directive) to write directly
 to your webservers html data directory. (for example on debian system
 I set dir_html /var/www/htdocs/penemo/)



RUNNING PENEMO

 penemo is not a daemon, it is meant to be run in a cron job every couple of
 minutes (or however often you want). Before setting up a cron job however
 I recommend running penemo from the command line (as root) and watch the
 output to make sure its running correctly (i.e. has all options it needs 
 set correctly, and the agent.conf file is configured correctly). and
 double check its html output.
 
 this is what i have in my /etc/crontab:

        */5 *  * * *  root  /usr/local/sbin/penemo 2> /dev/null 1> /dev/null

 this configuration runs penemo every 5 minutes and pipes all output to
 /dev/null (otherwise it gets sent to root@localhost I believe).



CHECK PLUGINS

 penemo plugins are a way for the administrator to write scripts to do
 custom checks, and integrate the results into penemo (centralized 
 monitoring management).

 please read the doc/plugins.txt for more information.



NOTIFY EXEC

 The notify_exec function in penemo is still in development, yet it
 is (as far as I know) completely functional and works fine (I'll
 wait and see if I get any bug reports). The way you use it is
 to have a script in the exec directory (specified in the penemo.conf
 with the dir_exec directive: by default it's in /usr/local/share/penemo/exec)
 this script will be called (no command line parameters) and the errors
 will be given on the STDIN. (note: the example script in the exec dir
 that comes with this program is a good working base to work from). From
 there you can do whatever you want, dial out on a modem, establish some
 socket connection somewhere etc. you have the error list to play with.

 The way you enable the notify exec in penemo is to edit the penemo.conf
 change the notify_method for whichever tier level you are planning to
 use the script for to exec instead of email. Then uncomment the 
 notify_exec_<whichever tier you wanted> line and as its value, enter
 the name of the file. NOTE: one word, no spaces, no command line params.
 If this filename exists in the dir_exec, everything shoudl go fine.
