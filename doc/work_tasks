[!] notify_exec (pain in the ass)
    (note: try notify_exec_name to group by, instead of actual notify_exec)

[!] make a function for "quick list of checks(above)" to do colors for if
    errors etc. and display for anywhere by calling the function to incorporate
    on main page as well as config page, etc.

[!] localize all config options, so there is no "global" conf file (penemo.conf)
    they all reside in one conf file (agent.conf format) with a DEFAULT_CONFIG
    being the default for each agent.

[!] command line parameters

[!] agent history using penemo output, stored in a file, and a cgi (penemo-admin) to
    run different queries on the data file etc.

[?] make http its own obj, or something, impliment multi-http checks.

[?] it'd be nice to have some sort of informational page for agent history
      that shows downtimes, durations, other misc stuff.
