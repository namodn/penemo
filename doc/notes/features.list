Ideas for features in future releases of penemo.

 - XML agent.conf
 - better written snmp mib parsers.
 - snmptrap support.
 - templating display system.
 - gateway devices (i.e. if this gateway device goes down, pause checking
   for all devices flagged "behind" the gateway, or something).
 - write some checks for basic things (telnet, ftp, ssh, http etc.).
